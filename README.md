# Brief notes on understanding intelligence
Really quick notes for my own reference so pardon the untidiness. Will occasionally copy paste directly from the papers!

Notes focused on papers which in my opinion are delivering interesting algorithmic insights/ advancements towards understanding intelligence.

## Data
for training, retrieval, curriculum

Tinystories: quality data is impt
- Web search
- Document DBs (eg Wikidata in [CoK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13269))
- Knowledge graphs (eg via SPARQL in [CoK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13269))
- Wiki and API (as in ReAct)
- Table corpora (eg WikiTables in [CoK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13269))
- Other data sets (eg ScienceQA in [CoK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13269))
