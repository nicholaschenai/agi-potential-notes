# When and how to learn procedural skills?
- attempt task with code and store if task success [voyager](papers/voyager.md)
- attempt task with code and store if task success and critic rates it at least 8/10 [oscopilot](papers/oscopilot.md)
- write code only when LM determines that existing tools cannot solve task [LATM](papers/LATM.md)
- synthesis and compression of code [LILO](../papers/LILO.md)
- After every test run, sample thought and action trajectories, use LLM/rules to extract reusable workflows (trajectory templates) [agent-workflow-memory](../papers/agent-workflow-memory.md)
