# Symbolic growth
Note: This is an arbitrary term I use to refer to the generic enhancement of the symbolic side in a neuro-symbolic system, which can be things like
- Discovering more primitives (Proper term: primitive discovery / construction)
- Enhancing existing primitives
- Composing/sequencing primitives into more complex actions (Proper term: compositional learning, the understanding of how to do so is called compositional generalization)
