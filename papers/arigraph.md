# Description of result
- semantic + episodic construction of KG while exploring env
- "outperforms established methods
such as full-history, summarization, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation in
various tasks, including the cooking challenge from the First TextWorld Problems
competition and novel tasks like house cleaning and puzzle Treasure Hunting"
- also outperforms RL baselines like GATA, LTL-GATA, and EXPLORER
- comparable to humans in terms of scores and speed
- total cost 900 USD

## KG
### definitions
- semantic nodes related by semantic edge of triplets (subj rel obj)
- episodic nodes are obs, episodic "hyperedges" (see their footnote for caveat) connect all episodic n semantic nodes that occur at the same time
### construction
- construction via LLM extracting entities
### maintenance
- outdated semantic rel edges detected by comparing with ablating the semantic edge. after clearing, new nodes are added
## Retrieval

- semantic search for triplets via Contriever model
- episodic search: given triblets, return most relevant episodic vertices

## Decision making
via ReAct

## Planning
"uses content of working memory to create new or update existing plan as a series of task-relevant
sub-goals, each accompanied by a concise description. The planning module also evaluates the
outcomes of actions based on feedback from the environment after each action at step tâˆ’1, adjusting
the plan accordingly."
