# Description of result
- semantic + episodic construction of KG while exploring env
- "outperforms established methods
such as full-history, summarization, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation in
various tasks, including the cooking challenge from the First TextWorld Problems
competition and novel tasks like house cleaning and puzzle Treasure Hunting"
- also outperforms RL baselines like GATA, LTL-GATA, and EXPLORER
- comparable to humans in terms of scores and speed
- total cost 900 USD
- recent repo includes evals on QA

## KG
### definitions
- semantic nodes related by semantic edge of triplets (subj rel obj)
- episodic nodes are obs, episodic "hyperedges" (see their footnote for caveat) connect all episodic n semantic nodes that occur at the same time (basically all the triplets at that snapshot in time)
### construction
- entities extracted from LLM given obs and plan, each assigned an importance score.
- relations extracted from LLM given obs and prev triplets

### maintenance
- when new triplets introduced, entities in them form a set which edges are retrieved (associated triplets), and neighbors appended to that set. Repeat for `steps=1` (BFS of depth 1)
- associated triplets and new triplets sent to LLM to determine of any triplet needs replacing
	- duplicate existing triplet removal by prompting LM to replace both of them
- outdated semantic rel edges detected by comparing with ablating the semantic edge. after clearing, new nodes are added
## Retrieval

### Semantic search
semantic search for triplets via Contriever model. impt as nodes may be similar (eg 'grill' and 'grilling') but are not captured by rigid (eg keyword) search

depth determined by importance score

### episodic search

simplified: given previous subgraph (result of semantic search in prev round), current episodic (observation, triplets at that point in time, obs ebd) and plan, each observation is given a score via
1) First get vec similarity of that observation with the plan (normalized)
2) Then for that observation, with its set of triplets, calculate the overlaping number of triplets with prev subgraph (normalized by num triplets in the episode containing the obs) but adjusted with eqn (1)
3) sum these 2 scores, return the top k episodic that isnt in the `n_prev` observations (because last `n_prev` obs is directly shown in prompts)

## Decision making
via ReAct

## Planning
"uses content of working memory to create new or update existing plan as a series of task-relevant
sub-goals, each accompanied by a concise description. The planning module also evaluates the
outcomes of actions based on feedback from the environment after each action at step tâˆ’1, adjusting
the plan accordingly."

- LLM classify if subgoal requires exploring
