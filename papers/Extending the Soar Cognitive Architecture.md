### Summary of the Work Including Key Contributions

focuses on extending the Soar cognitive architecture to enhance its capabilities in modeling general intelligent agents. Traditionally, Soar relied on symbolic representations and a minimal number of architectural modules. The key contributions of this work include the introduction of non-symbolic representations, new learning mechanisms, and long-term memories to Soar. These extensions aim to increase the functionality of Soar for creating artificial general intelligent systems and expand the breadth of human behavior that can be modeled using Soar. The major additions include working memory activation, reinforcement learning, semantic memory, episodic memory, visual imagery, and clustering.
# Description of result
The extended Soar architecture incorporates new components that have been built, integrated, and run with traditional Soar components. These components include working memory activation, reinforcement learning, semantic memory, episodic memory, visual imagery, and clustering. Each component enhances Soar's ability to model human-like cognitive processes and improve its performance in dynamic environments.

# How it compares to previous work


The extended Soar architecture builds upon the traditional Soar by retaining its strengths, such as flexible control and meta-reasoning, while expanding the types of knowledge it can represent, reason with, and learn. Unlike previous versions, the extended Soar includes non-symbolic processing and new memory modules that capture knowledge that is cumbersome to learn and encode in rules. This makes Soar more aligned with human cognitive capabilities and enhances its functionality as a general intelligent system.

#### How Was the Work Evaluated

The work was evaluated through empirical results that verified the improvements in episodic memory retrieval due to working memory activation (Nuxoll & Laird 2007). The integration of new components was tested by running them with traditional Soar components, although a single unified system with all components running simultaneously has not yet been achieved.

#### Evaluation Performance and Comparison to Other Works

The extended Soar architecture demonstrated improved episodic memory retrieval and the ability to model advanced cognitive capabilities such as internal simulation, prediction, learning action models, and retrospective reasoning. These enhancements position Soar as a more comprehensive cognitive architecture compared to others like ACT-R and EPIC, which have not incorporated some of the cognitive capabilities studied in Soar.

# Main strategies used to obtain results
 integrating new components into the Soar architecture, such as working memory activation, reinforcement learning, semantic memory, episodic memory, visual imagery, and clustering. These components were designed to work with Soar's existing symbolic processing and decision-making mechanisms, enhancing its ability to model human-like cognitive processes.

### Any Other Important Info

#### Weaknesses of Method

One weakness is that a single unified system with all new components running simultaneously has not yet been achieved. Additionally, the integration of new modules requires further exploration to fully understand their interactions and synergies.

#### Future Work

Future work involves exploring the interactions and synergies of the new components, such as using 

- apply activation to semantic mem. 
- reinforcement learning to learn the best cues for retrieving knowledge from episodic memory. 
- use episodic for retrospective learning to train RL on impt exp
- how emotion and visual imagery are captured and used in episodic memory, 
- how knowledge might move between episodic and semantic memories.
- how might emotion and working mem activation influence learning n retrieval of declarative mem?


### Biological Inspiration

Some mechanisms, such as clustering, are inspired by biological processes. The clustering module is based on research by Richard Granger, which derives algorithms from the processing of thalamocortical loops in the brain, where clustering and successive sub-clustering of inputs occur using winner-take-all circuits.
